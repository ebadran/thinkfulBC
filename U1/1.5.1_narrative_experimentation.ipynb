    "A police department plans to equip all on-duty officers with body-worn cameras, to increase oversight and accountability. The cameras will be attached to officer's uniforms and will record audio, video, and GPS locations. Officers will be required to keep devices in recording mode during their entire shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The department will conduct a 6-months randomized-controlled trial to assess the effects of cameras in officer's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The police department has more than 1000 uniformed officers, distributed in over four \"policing districts\" of similar size.  The experiment will initiate with a 2-month pilot with 50 cameras in one of the districts. If the pilot is successful, the experiment will scale-up to 200 cameras in the other three districts, for the remaining four months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key metric of interest is a 10% reduction in the use-of-force rates of officers wearing bodycameras**, as opposed to officers not wearing cameras in the same locations and period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since use of lethal force is relatively rare, the experiment will assess both physical and lethal force, to ensure sufficient statistical power for the given sample size and duration of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, given that the cameras broadcast officer's real-time locations to back-office, the department wants to assess whether the technology can help **reduce by at least 15% the average emergency response time, as a secondary metric of interest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each of the four selected districts, there will be 50 randomly selected \"treatment\" officers wearing cameras; and 50 randomly assigned \"control\" officers not wearing cameras. Care will be taken to ensure that the age and gender distribution of treatment and control officers is (approximately) proportional to the entire department. If otherwise, the randomization procedure will be repeated. The experiment will occur between April and September, to avoid the winter season."

The dispatch time is also recorded, as well as the precise time when officers arrive at the incident's location. An additional variable will be recorded for the purpose of the experiment - whether officers who attended to the event were wearing cameras or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment will disaggregate and analyze the data by district, to account for regional differences in crime levels. Also, the study will look at historical data to verify if any treatment officer has a history of higher use-of-force rates, and if necessary, discard any outlying data."
